An ATmega16 based clock on steroids

This is DS1307 + ATmega based digital clock, made for Embedded Systems course. Developed on mega16 at the university (cause everyone were using mega8 for no reason), switched to mega8 later.
Includes multiplexing, I2C interfacing, battery backup power and buttons for setting time and brightness. Powered by an old phone charger ~5V.
